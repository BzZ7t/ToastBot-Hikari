// All strings can be formatted into the following,
// {member} - mention a user
// {server} - current name of the server
// {count} - Number of members in a server

// You can also use /r to make a list of messages that the bot will randomly choose from
// An example of that would be message1/rmessage2

// is there a better way of doing this?
// Yes, but not at my brain IQ, thanks for the compliment 

// will probably make this into nested dictionaries like welcome:{thing: value} instead of welcome_{thing}: value
